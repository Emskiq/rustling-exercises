# Rustling exercises

Solved [Rustling](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises.
- Version used: 5.6.1

This repository and future ones will serve as a documentation of my Rust learning path. 

There is no better way to solidify one's understanding of a subject than by explaining it to others or recounting one's own perspective. This README aims to capture my insights and experiences during the process.

# C++ vs Rust

## Similarities 

### - Syntax structure.
Rust's syntax closely resembles that of C++, as both are [statically and strongly typed languages](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/tip/Static-vs-dynamic-typing-The-details-and-differences). Many keywords and basic types are similar between the two. Rust is expressive, and some argue it is easier to read (though I may reserve judgment on that until I become more familiar with it).

### - Some similar concepts
- similar concept with the borrowing and 'std::unique_ptr'
- similarities with the Rc<T> and std::shared_ptr

## Upgrades from C++
- memory management done at compile time??
- templtate just like in C++, however concepts are enabled by default
